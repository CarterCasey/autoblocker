		<p>For my final project in CS150-06, Natural Language Processing, I'm attempting to apply Maximum Entropy classification to automatically blocking accounts on Twitter. The process will involve three steps: Training, in which I gather data and select features of users on which to base the classification; Evaluation, in which the weights for those features are tuned to the problem; and Deployment, in which I make the tool available.</p>
		<p>If you would like to help me with this project, you can go to the <a href="/training.html">training</a> page and allow me to use your following and blocked lists to train (and later evaluate) the model. Please note: I <em>am</em> asking you for personal information, information that twitter keeps private from outside users. Please do not give me any information if you're even a little bit uncomfortable doing so - it's just a final project, and I will find a way to make it work.</p>
