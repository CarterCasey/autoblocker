	<div class="description">
		<p>In order to train the blocker, I'll need data. While I can find and generate large artificial data sets, I'd also like to use real-world data sets - namely, real blocked lists. If you would like to help me do so (and, as I say elsewhere, it's really okay if you don't), you may allow this site to collect data from your twitter account. This data will include your list of blocked users, as well as your user id, list of followers, and list of followed accounts. If you would like to contribute that information, please click on the authorization link below.</p>
